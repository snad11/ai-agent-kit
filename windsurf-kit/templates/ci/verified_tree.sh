# CI only. Tells a verify job whether the exact code it checked out has already passed
# verification in an earlier run, so a merge that moves the same code to the next branch
# does not repeat the same checks. The key is the git tree SHA: it names the file contents,
# so it survives merge commits but changes with any edit, including lockfiles, tool version
# files and the workflows themselves. A successful full run uploads an artifact named
# verified-<salt>-<tree>. Artifacts are repo-wide; Actions caches are branch-scoped, so a
# cache cannot carry the marker from one branch to the next.
#
# Stack-agnostic: it knows nothing about the language or the checks being skipped.
#
# Env: GH_TOKEN (needs the actions: read permission), GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_OUTPUT
# Writes to GITHUB_OUTPUT: tree, marker, verified (true | false)
#
# Usage, from the repo root:
#   bash tool/ci/verified_tree.sh
set -euo pipefail

# Bump to make every tree verify again, e.g. after a runner or toolchain change.
